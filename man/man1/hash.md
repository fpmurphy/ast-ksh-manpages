# NAME

alias - define or display aliases

# SYNOPSIS

`alias` \[ `options` \] \[name\[=value\]...\]

# DESCRIPTION

`alias` creates or redefines alias definitions or writes the existing
alias definitions to standard output. An alias definitions provides a
string value that will replace a command name when the command is read.
Alias names can contain any printable character which is not special to
the shell. If an alias value ends in a space or tab, then the word
following the command name the alias replaces is also checked to see
whether it is an alias.

If no `name`s are specified then the names and values of all aliases are
written to standard output. Otherwise, for each `name` that is
specified, and `=``value` is not specified, the current value of the
alias corresponding to `name` is written to standard output. If
`=``value` is specified, the alias `name` will be created or
redefined.

`alias` is built-in to the shell as a declaration command so that
field splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the
arguments. Tilde expansion occurs on `value`. An alias definition only
affects scripts read by the current shell environment. It does not
effect scripts run by this shell.

# OPTIONS

-`p`
: Causes the output to be in the form of alias commands that can be
    used as input to the shell to recreate the current aliases.

-`t`
: Used for tracked aliases. These are aliases that connect a command
    name to the pathname of the command and are reset when the `PATH`
    variable is unset. The tracked aliases feature is now obsolete.

-`x`
: Ignored, this option is obsolete.

# EXIT STATUS

`0`
: Successful completion.

`&gt;0`
: One or more `name` operands did not have an alias definition, or an
    error occurred.
