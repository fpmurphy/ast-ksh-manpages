# NAME

3d - execute a command with nDFS filesystem services enabled

# SYNOPSIS

`3d` \[ `options` \] \[ command \[ arg ... \] \]

# DESCRIPTION

`3d` executes a dynamically linked `command` with `n``DFS`
filesystem services enabled. It intercepts pathname system calls and
applies the `n``DFS` operations specified by the `VPATH` environment
variable, the command line mounts, and the `vpath` command. If
`command` is omitted then an interactive
[`sh`](/web/20150527154819/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/man/man1/sh.html)(1)
is started. All processes executed by `command` also have `n``DFS`
enabled.
The main `3d` service is `viewpathing`. A `viewpath` mounts one
directory tree on top of another. Files in the top level (directory
tree) obscure files in the lower level. Lower level files have
copy-on-write semantics to the top level. i.e., files in the lower level
are readonly; if a lower level file is modified it is first copied to
the top level before modification. Viewpath mounted directories can be
chained. All levels but the top in a chain are readonly. The traditional
`VPATH=``d1:d2:d3` viewpathing is specified by the two `3d` mounts
"`d1 d2`" and "`d2 d3`".

The following service mounts are initialized by default:

`/dev/fd`
:   `/dev/fd/``n` refers to the open file descriptor `n` in the
    current process.

`/dev/fdp`
:   `/dev/fdp/local/``service` opens a 2-way stream to `service` on
    the local host. The stream supports file descriptor exchange.

`/dev/tcp`
:   `/dev/tcp/``host``/``service` opens a 2-way connection to
    `service` on `host`.
    [`inetd`](/web/20150527154819/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/man/man8/inetd.html)(8)
    services are named either by `inet.``service` or by port number.

`/dev/udp`
:   `/dev/udb/``host``/``service` opens a datagram connection to
    `service` on `host`.
    [`inetd`](/web/20150527154819/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/man/man8/inetd.html)(8)
    services are named either by `inet.``service` or by port number.

# OPTIONS

-`c`, --`command`
:   Ignored; allows `3d` to be invoked like
    [`sh`](/web/20150527154819/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/man/man1/sh.html)(1).

-`d`, --`debug`=`level`
:   Set the debug trace level to `level`. Higher levels produce
    more output.

-`l`, --`lite`
:   Disable the default service mounts.

-`m`, --`mount`=`"top bottom"`
:   Mount the path `top` onto the path `bottom`. If `bottom` is a
    directory then the directory `top` is viewpathed on top of `bottom`.
    Otherwise `bottom` must match a `3d` `fs` path of the form
    `/\#``special`.

-`n`, --`exec`
:   Execute `command`. `--noexec` shows how `command` would be invoked
    but does not execute. On by default; -`n` means --`noexec`.

-`o`, --`output`=`file`
:   `--trace` and `--debug` output is written to `file` instead of
    the standard error.

-`s`, --`shell`=`file`
:   Sets the
    [`sh`](/web/20150527154819/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/man/man1/sh.html)(1)
    executable path to `file` . The default value is `ksh`.

-`t`, --`trace`=`id`
:   If `id` is `1` then intercepted system calls for all child
    processes will be traced. If `id` is greater than `1` then
    intercepted system calls for the current process and all children
    will be traced.

-`v`, --`version`=`major.minor`
:   Use `3d` version `major.minor` instead of the latest version.

-`x`
: Passed to the `3d`
    [`sh`](/web/20150527154819/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/man/man1/sh.html)(1).

# FS PATHS

`3d` `fs` paths of the form `/\#``special`\[`/`...\] control the
semantics of `3d` and allow services to be attached to the file
namespace. Unsupported `fs` paths are silently ignored. The supported
`fs` paths are:
[`/\#fd`]()
[`/\#fs/``name`\[/`option`/...\]]()
[`/\#map`]()
[`/\#null`]()
[`/\#option`]()
[`2d`]()
[`3d`]()
[`boundary`]()
[`call=``value`]()
[`count=``value`]()
[`debug=``level`]()
[`dump=`\[`value`\]]()
[`call=``value`]()
[`file=``value`]()
[`fs=``value`]()
[`map=``value`]()
[`mount=``value`]()
[`safe=``value`]()
[`state=``value`]()
[`view=``value`]()
[`file=``value`]()
[`fork`]()
[`init`]()
[`license=``path`]()
[`mount=``value`]()
[`table=``value`]()
[`test=``bitmask`]()
[`timeout=``value`]()
[`timestamp`]()
[`trace=``value`]()
[`version=1`]()
[`/\#pwd`]()
[`/\#safe`]()
[`/\#view`]()

# DETAILS

`n``DFS` semantics are applied by intercepting system calls with a dll
that is preloaded at process startup before `main` () is called. The
interception mechanism may involve the environment on some systems; in
those cases commands like
[`env`](/web/20150527154819/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/man/man1/env.html)(1)
that clear the enviroment before execution may defeat the `3d`
intercepts. The intercepted system calls are listed by `vpath -
/\#option/dump=call`. Note that implementation system call names may
differ from those listed in section 2 of the manual;
[`stat`](/web/20150527154819/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/man/man2/stat.html)(2)
is especially vulnerbale to mangling.
`3d` ignores calls not present in a particular host system. In
addition, `3d` only works on dynamically linked executables that have
neither set-uid nor set-gid permissions. It may not have the intended
effect on programs written in a language or linked with a language
runtime that hides or mangles system call library symbols, or that
directly emit system call instruction sequences rather than using the
corresponding library functions, or that dynamically link libraries
outside of the scope of the `3d` intercepts.

Multi-process client-server applications may misbehave if the `3d`
environment between the related processes is not kept in sync.

# ENVIRONMENT

`3d` is implemented by four components: the `3d` script, located on
`\$PATH`; the `3d` dll (shared library), located either on
`\$PATH` or in one of the `../lib`\` directories on `\$PATH`,
depending on local compilation system conventions; and the `2d`
[`sh`](/web/20150527154819/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/man/man1/sh.html)(1)
alias and `\_2d`
[`sh`](/web/20150527154819/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/man/man1/sh.html)(1)
function that allow commands to be run with `n``DFS` semantics
disabled. Systems like `sgi.mips3` that support multiple a.out formats
may have multiple versions of the `3d` dll. In all cases the `3d`
script handles the dll search.
