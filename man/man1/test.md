# NAME

test - evaluate expression

# SYNOPSIS

`test` \[ `options` \] \[expression\]

# DESCRIPTION

`test` evaluates expressions and indicates its results based on the
exit status. Option parsing is not performed so that all arguments,
including `--` are processed as operands. The evaluation of the
expression depends on the number of operands as follows:

`0`
: Evaluates to false.

`1`
: True if argument is not an empty string.

`2`
: If first operand is `!`, the result is True if the second operand
    an empty string. Otherwise, it is evaluated as one of the unary
    expressions defined below. If the unary operator is invalid and the
    second argument is `--`,then the first argument is processed as an
    option argument.

`3`
: If first operand is `!`, the result is True if the second and
    third operand evaluated as a unary expression is False. Otherwise,
    the three operands are evaluaged as one of the binary expressions
    listed below.

`4`
: If first operand is `!`, the result is True if the next three
    operands are a valid binary expression that is False.

Unary expressions can be one of the following:

`-a` `file`
: True if `file` exists, obsolete.

`-b` `file`
: True if `file` exists and is a block special file.

`-c` `file`
: True if `file` exists and is a character special file.

`-d` `file`
: True if `file` exists and is a directory.

`-e` `file`
: True if `file` exists.

`-f` `file`
: True if `file` exists and is a regular file.

`-g` `file`
: True if `file` exists and has its set-group-id bit set.

`-h` `file`
: True if `file` exists and is a symbolic link.

`-k` `file`
: True if `file` exists and has its sticky bit on.

`-n` `string`
: True if length of `string` is non-zero.

`-o` `option`
: True if the shell option `option` is enabled.

`-p` `file`
: True if `file` exists and is a pipe or fifo.

`-r` `file`
: True if `file` exists and is readable.

`-s` `file`
: True if `file` exists and has size &gt; 0.

`-t` `fildes`
: True if file descriptor number `fildes` is open and is associated
    with a terminal device.

`-u` `file`
: True if `file` exists and has its set-user-id bit set.

`-v` `varname`
: True if `varname` is a valid variable name that is set.

`-w` `file`
: True if `file` exists and is writable.

`-x` `file`
: True if `file` exists and is executable. For a directory it means
    that it can be searched.

`-z` `string`
: True if `string` is a zero length string.

`-G` `file`
: True if `file` exists and group is the effective group id of the
    current process.

`-L` `file`
: True if `file` exists and is a symbolic link.

`-N` `file`
: True if `file` exists and has been modified since it was last read.

`-O` `file`
: True if `file` exists and owner is the effective user id of the
    current process.

`-R` `varname`
: True if `varname` is a name reference.

`-S` `file`
: True if `file` exists and is a socket.

Binary expressions can be one of the following:

`string1` = `string2`
: True if `string1` is equal to `string2`.

`string1` == `string2`
: True if `string1` is equal to `string2`.

`string1` != `string2`
: True if `string1` is not equal to `string2`.

`num1` -eq `num2`
: True if numerical value of `num1` is equal to `num2`.

`num1` -ne `num2`
: True if numerical value of `num1` is not equal to `num2`.

`num1` -lt `num2`
: True if numerical value of `num1` is less than `num2`.

`num1` -le `num2`
: True if numerical value of `num1` is less than or equal to `num2`.

`num1` -gt `num2`
: True if numerical value of `num1` is greater than `num2`.

`num1` -ge `num2`
: True if numerical value of `num1` is greater than or equal to
    `num2`.

`file1` -nt `file2`
: True if `file1` is newer than `file2` or `file2` does not exist.

`file1` -ot `file2`
: True if `file1` is older than `file2` or `file2` does not exist.

`file1` -ef `file2`
: True if `file1` is another name for `file2`. This will be true if
    `file1` is a hard link or a symbolic link to `file2`.

# EXIT STATUS

`0`
: Indicates that the specified expression is True.

`1`
: Indicates that the specified expression is False.

`&gt;1`
: An error occurred.
