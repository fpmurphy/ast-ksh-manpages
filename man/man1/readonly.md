# NAME

readonly - set readonly attribute on variables

# SYNOPSIS

`readonly` \[ `options` \] \[name\[=value\]...\]

# DESCRIPTION

`readonly` sets the readonly attribute on each of the variables
specified by `name` which prevents their values from being changed. If
`=``value` is specified, the variable `name` is set to `value` before
the variable is made readonly.

Within a type definition, if the value is not specified, then a value
must be specified when creating each instance of the type and the value
is readonly for each instance.

If no `name`s are specified then the names and values of all readonly
variables are written to standard output.

`readonly` is built-in to the shell as a declaration command so that
field splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the
arguments. Tilde expansion occurs on `value`.

# OPTIONS

-`p`
: Causes the output to be in a form of `readonly` commands that can
    be used as input to the shell to recreate the current set of
    readonly variables.

# EXIT STATUS

`0`
: Successful completion.

`&gt;0`
: An error occurred.
