# NAME

eval - create a shell command and process it

# SYNOPSIS

`eval` \[ `options` \] \[arg...\]

# DESCRIPTION

`eval` is a shell special built-in command that constructs a command
by concatenating the `arg`s together, separating each with a space. The
resulting string is then taken as input to the shell and evaluated in
the current environment. Note that command words are expanded twice;
once to construct `arg`, and again when the shell executes the
constructed command.

It is not an error if `arg` is not given.

# EXIT STATUS

If `arg` is not specified, the exit status is `0`. Otherwise, it is
the exit status of the command defined by the `arg` operands.
