# NAME

jobs - display status of jobs

# SYNOPSIS

`jobs` \[ `options` \] \[job ...\]

# DESCRIPTION

`jobs` displays information about specified `job`s that were started
by the current shell environment on standard output. The information
contains the job number enclosed in \[...\], the status, and the command
line that started the job.

If `job` is omitted, `jobs` displays the status of all stopped jobs,
background jobs, and all jobs whose status has changed since last
reported by the shell.

When `jobs` reports the termination status of a job, the shell removes
the jobs from the list of known jobs in the current shell environment.

`number`
: `number` refers to a process id.

: Refers to a job whose name begins with `string`.

`%?``string`
: Refers to a job whose name contains `string`.

`%+` or `%%`
: Refers to the current job.

`%-`
: Refers to the previous job.
