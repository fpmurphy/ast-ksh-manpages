# NAME

unset - unset values and attributes of variables and functions

# SYNOPSIS

`unset` \[ `options` \] name...

# DESCRIPTION

For each `name` specified, `unset` unsets the variable, or function if
`-f` is specified, from the current shell execution environment.
Readonly variables cannot be unset.

# OPTIONS

-`n`
: If `name` refers to variable that is a reference, the variable
    `name` will be unset rather than the variable it references.
    Otherwise, is is equivalent to `-v`.

-`f`
: `name` refers to a function name and the shell will unset the
    function definition.

-`v`
: `name` refers to a variable name and the shell will unset it and
    remove it from the environment. This is the default behavior.

# EXIT STATUS

`0`
: All `name`s were successfully unset.

`&gt;0`
: One or more `name` operands could not be unset or an error occurred.
