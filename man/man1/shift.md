# NAME

shift - shift positional parameters

# SYNOPSIS

`shift` \[ `options` \] \[n\]

# DESCRIPTION

`shift` is a shell special built-in that shifts the positional
parameters to the left by the number of places defined by `n`, or `1`
if `n` is omitted. The number of positional parameters remaining will be
reduced by the number of places that are shifted.

If `n` is given, it will be evaluated as an arithmetic expression to
determinate the number of places to shift. It is an error to shift more
than the number of positional parameters or a negative number of places.

# EXIT STATUS

`0`
: The positional parameters were successfully shifted.

`&gt;0`
: An error occurred.
