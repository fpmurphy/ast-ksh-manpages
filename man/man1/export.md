# NAME

export - set export attribute on variables

# SYNOPSIS

`export` \[ `options` \] \[name\[=value\]...\]

# DESCRIPTION

`export` sets the export attribute on each of the variables specified
by `name` which causes them to be in the environment of subsequently
executed commands. If `=``value` is specified, the variable `name` is
set to `value`.

If no `name`s are specified then the names and values of all exported
variables are written to standard output.

`export` is built-in to the shell as a declaration command so that
field splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the
arguments. Tilde expansion occurs on `value`.

# OPTIONS

-`p`
: Causes the output to be in the form of `export` commands that can
    be used as input to the shell to recreate the current exports.

# EXIT STATUS

`0`
: Successful completion.

`&gt;0`
: An error occurred.
