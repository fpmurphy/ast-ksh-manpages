# NAME

return - return from a function or dot script

# SYNOPSIS

`return` \[ `options` \] \[n\]

# DESCRIPTION

`return` is a shell special built-in that causes the function or dot
script that invokes it to exit. If `return` is invoked outside of a
function or dot script it is equivalent to `exit`.

If `return` is invoked inside a function defined with the `function`
reserved word syntax, then any `EXIT` trap set within the then
function will be invoked in the context of the caller before the
function returns.

If `n` is given, it will be used to set the exit status.

# EXIT STATUS

If `n` is specified, the exit status is the least significant eight bits
of the value of `n`. Otherwise, the exit status is the exit status of
preceding command.
