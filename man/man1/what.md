# NAME

what - display binary identification strings

# SYNOPSIS

`what` \[ `options` \] \[ file ... \]

# DESCRIPTION

`what` searches the given files for all occurrences of the
identification pattern `@(\#)` or `\$Id:` and writes a line to the
standard output containing the text that follows until the first
occurrence of one of the following: `" &lt; &gt; \\ \$ newline NUL`.
If no `file` is given or if a `file` is `-` then the standard
input is read. The name of each input file, followed by a `:`, is also
written as a separate line to the standard output.
