# NAME

css - multiplex multiple clients on one connect stream server

# SYNOPSIS

`css` \[ `options` \] connect-stream command \[ arg ... \]

# DESCRIPTION

`css` multiplexes multiple clients on one filter server. A filter
server is a process that reads lines from the standard input and writes
result lines to the standard output. `connect-stream` is the connect
stream path by which the filter service will be known.

# OPTIONS

-`t`, --`timeout`=`time`
:   The service will exit after a `time` period of client inactivity.

# PROTOCOL

A filter service must follow a simple line oriented protocol. All client
lines are split into arguments and a number is inserted in the second
argument position. This number, followed by a space, must be placed at
the beginning of each line written by the filter server for the given
client request.
