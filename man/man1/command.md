# NAME

command - execute a simple command

# SYNOPSIS

`command` \[ `options` \] \[command \[arg ...\]\]

# DESCRIPTION

Without `-v` or `-V`, `command` executes `command` with arguments
given by `arg`, suppressing the shell function lookup that normally
occurs. In addition, if `command` is a special built-in command, then
the special properties are removed so that failures will not cause the
script that executes it to terminate.

With the `-v` or `-V` options, `command` is equivalent to the
[`whence`](/web/20141128030241/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/man/man1/whence.html)(1)
command.

# OPTIONS

-`p`
: Causes a default path to be searched rather than the one defined by
    the value of `PATH`.

-`v`
: Equivalent to `whence` `command` \[`arg` ...\].

-`x`
: If `command` fails because there are too many `arg`s, it will be
    invoked multiple times with a subset of the arguments on
    each invocation. Arguments that occur prior to the first word that
    expand to multiple arguments and arguments that occur after the last
    word that expands to multiple arguments will be passed on
    each invocation. The exit status will be the maximum invocation
    exit status.

-`V`
: Equivalent to `whence` -v `` `command` \[`arg` ...\].

# EXIT STATUS

If `command` is invoked, the exit status of `command` will be that of
`command`. Otherwise, it will be one of the following:

`0`
: `command` completed successfully.

`&gt;0`
: `-v` or `-V` has been specified and an error occurred.

`126`
: `command` was found but could not be invoked.

`127`
: `command` could not be found.
