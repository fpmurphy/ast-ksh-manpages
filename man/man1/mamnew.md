# NAME

mamnew - make abstract machine to nmake makefile conversion filter

# SYNOPSIS

`mamnew` \[ `options` \]

# DESCRIPTION

`mamnew` reads MAM (Make Abstract Machine) target and prerequisite
file descriptions from the standard input and writes an equivalent
[`nmake`](/web/20141128030246/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/man/man1/nmake.html)(1)
makefile on the standard output. Mamfiles are generated by the `--mam`
option of
[`nmake`](/web/20141128030246/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/man/man1/nmake.html)(1)
and
[`gmake`](/web/20141128030246/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/man/man1/gmake.html)(1).
Symbolic information is preserved where possible in the output makefile.
Comments, however, are lost in the conversion. Header file dependencies
are omitted since these are implicitly determined by
[`nmake`](/web/20141128030246/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/man/man1/nmake.html)(1).
Recursive makefiles are not converted; each makefile level must be
converted separately. Some targets are omitted; most of these are
provided as predefined
[`nmake`](/web/20141128030246/http://www2.research.att.com/~astopen/man/man1/nmake.html)(1)
targets.

`mamnew` is only an `aid` in the makefile conversion process. It is a
rare old-make makefile that requires no manual intervention after
`mamnew` conversion.

# OPTIONS

-`d`, --`debug`=`level` -`x`, --`omit`=`prefix`
