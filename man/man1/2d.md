# NAME

2d - Run a command in a 2d environment

# SYNOPSIS

`2d` \[ `-` \] \[ `+` \] \[ `arg` \] ...

# DESCRIPTION

`2d` without arguments, invokes a version of the shell that does not
support the 3d file system. If `arg` does not begin with a `-`, then
`2d` executes the command in an environment which does not support the
3d file system. If `arg` begines with a `-`, and is not exactly `-`,
then `2d` executes `\$SHELL` `arg`... in an environment which does
not support the 3d file system.

If the first argument to `2d` is `+` then all subsequent commands
issued from the same environment until `2d -` will be executed in an
environment that does not support the 3d file system. All remaining
arguments are ignored.
