If `job` is omitted, the most recently started or stopped background job
is moved to the foreground.

Each `job` can be specified as one of the following:

`number`
: `number` refers to a process id.

`-``number`
: `number` refers to a process group id.

`%``number`
: `number` refer to a job number.

`%``string`
: Refers to a job whose name begins with `string`.

`%?``string`

`%+` or `%%`
: Refers to the current job.

`%-`
: Refers to the previous job.

# EXIT STATUS

If `fg` brings one or more jobs into the foreground, the exit status
of `fg` will be that of the last `job`. If one or more jobs does not
exist or has completed, `fg` will return a non-zero exit status.
