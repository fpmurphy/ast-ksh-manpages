# NAME

nocom - strip comments from C source files

# SYNOPSIS

`nocom` \[ `options` \] \[ file ... \]

# DESCRIPTION

`nocom` strips `// ...` and `/\` ... \`/` comments from each C
source `file` and writes the result on the standard output. Comments
that span multiple lines are replaced by `newline` characters to
retain the original source line numbering. If `file` is omitted then the
standard input is read.
