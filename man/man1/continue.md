# NAME

continue - continue execution at top of the loop

# SYNOPSIS

`continue` \[ `options` \] \[n\]

# DESCRIPTION

`continue` is a shell special built-in that continues execution at the
top of smallest enclosing enclosing `for`, `select`, `while` , or
`until` loop, if any; or the top of the `n`-th enclosing loop if `n`
is specified.

If `n` is given, it must be a positive integer &gt;= 1. If `n` is larger
than the number of enclosing loops, the last enclosing loop will be
used.
