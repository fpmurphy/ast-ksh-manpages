# NAME

comm - select or reject lines common to two files

# SYNOPSIS

`comm` \[ `options` \] file1 file2

# DESCRIPTION

`comm` reads two files `file1` and `file2` which should be ordered in
the collating sequence of the current locale, and produces three text
columns as output:

`1`
: Lines only in `file1`.

`2`
: Lines only in `file2`.

`3`
: Lines in both files.

If lines in either file are not ordered according to the collating
sequence of the current locale, the results are not specified.
If either `file1` or `file2` is `-`, `comm` uses standard input
starting at the current location.

-`2`

-`3`
: Suppress the output column of lines duplicate in `file1` and
    `file2`.

# EXIT STATUS

`&gt;0`
