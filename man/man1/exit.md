# NAME

exit - exit the current shell

# SYNOPSIS

`exit` \[ `options` \] \[n\]

# DESCRIPTION

`exit` is shell special built-in that causes the shell that invokes it
to exit. Before exiting the shell, if the `EXIT` trap is set it will
be invoked.

If `n` is given, it will be used to set the exit status.

# EXIT STATUS

If `n` is specified, the exit status is the least significant eight bits
of the value of `n`. Otherwise, the exit status is the exit status of
preceding command. When invoked inside a trap, the preceding command
means the command that invoked the trap.
