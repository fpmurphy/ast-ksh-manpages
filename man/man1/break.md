# NAME

break - break out of loop

# SYNOPSIS

`break` \[ `options` \] \[n\]

# DESCRIPTION

`break` is a shell special built-in that exits the smallest enclosing
`for`, `select`, `while`, or `until` loop, or the `n`-th
enclosing loop if `n` is specified. Execution continues at the command
following the loop(s).

If `n` is given, it must be a positive integer &gt;= 1. If `n` is larger
than the number of enclosing loops, the last enclosing loop will be
exited.
